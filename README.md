# Lark - Rhythm Game Made with Unity

Lark is a game for PC and mobile that I made with a small team using Unity. You can play it on [itch.io](https://ds75.itch.io/lark).

This repository only includes the scripts for the game, since the purpose is to show my contributions as a programmer. The other assets, such as art, audio, and Unity-specific files, are in a private repo.

The scripts are organized into two folders:

* `MusicGame`: This folder contains scripts related to the rhythm portion of the game (swiping your finger up and down the screen to collect dots in time to the music).
* `Player-World`: This folder contains scripts related to the story portion of the game (walking around as the character in her room).

The other scripts not organized into folders are miscellaneous that apply throughout the game.
